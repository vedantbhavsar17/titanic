# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains my machine learning solution for the Titanic Survival Prediction problem.  
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical passenger data and basic machine learning techniques in Python.

This project is created mainly for learning purposes, focusing on data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Objective

The Titanic dataset is a popular beginner-friendly dataset used to understand how machine learning works on real-world data.

In this project, I work on:
- Exploring the dataset to understand patterns
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Training machine learning models
- Predicting survival outcomes

## What This Project Covers

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survival analysis based on gender, passenger class, age, and other features
- Understanding data distributions and missing values

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Preparing clean data for machine learning models

### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest or other basic classifiers
- Model training and evaluation

### Prediction
- Predicting survival for unseen test data
- Preparing output suitable for submission

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib and seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantbhavsar17/titanic.git
2. Open The Notebook
- jupyter notebook titanic.ipynb
  
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to see data analysis, model training, and predictions.

## Results and Learning
From this project, I learned:

- How real-world datasets contain missing and inconsistent data
- Why data preprocessing is a crucial step
- How different models behave on the same dataset
- The complete machine learning workflow from raw data to prediction

This project helped me build a strong foundation in classification problems.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis
- Deploying the model using Streamlit or Flask

## Dataset Source

The dataset is taken from the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle.
